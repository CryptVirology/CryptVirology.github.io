Markdown wins for research writing.

## Final recommendation (clear & direct)

**Use Markdown + Jekyll posts for technical content.**  
HTML is okay for static pages only.

This aligns with:
- Exploit dev culture
- Research expectations
- Long-term maintainability

## If you want help transitioning

I can:
- Convert one of your existing HTML pages → Markdown
- Help you restructure the repo cleanly
- Suggest a first *technical* Markdown post
- Review your Markdown before publishing

Just tell me:
👉 **Do you want to convert an existing post or write a new one first?**
